### <ins> Scheduling algorithm - Design <ins>

* To optimize the task scheduling for all airport stages, This includes the journey from the moment a plane lands until passengers depart the airport.

* The core scheduling process ensures that passengers at a specific airport phase can only proceed to the next phase when it has the capacity to receive them.

The primary airport phases for the scheduling process are defined as,

**Phase 1:** Transporting passengers from the aircraft to the gate waiting area and initiating medical procedures.

**Phase 2:** Transporting passengers from the gate hall to the passport checkpoints area.

**Phase 3:** Transporting passengers from the passport checkpoints to the luggage handling area.

**Phase 4:** Transporting passengers from the luggage handling area to the customs checkpoints area.

**Phase 5:** Transporting passengers from the customs checkpoints area to the Plaza area.
